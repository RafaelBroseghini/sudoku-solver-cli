## Sudoku Rules
  > The classic Sudoku game involves a grid of 81 squares. 
  The grid is divided into nine blocks, each containing nine squares. 
  The rules of the game are simple: each of the nine blocks has to contain all the numbers 1-9 within its squares. 
  Each number can only appear once in a row, column or box.
  
  * **Assume blocks are 3x3**
